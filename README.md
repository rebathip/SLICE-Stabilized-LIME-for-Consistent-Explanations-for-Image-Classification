# SLICE: Stabilized LIME for Consistent Explanations for Image Classification

![SLICE](slice_title_img.png)

Code for the paper published in CVPR 2024 (Highlight).

Steps:
1) Install required packages
2) run slice_test.py

In slice_test.py the explaner is run multiple time to check the consistency at each run but ideally this explainer can be run once.
